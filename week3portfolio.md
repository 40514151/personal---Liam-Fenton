Software Engineering Portfolio (week 3 entry)

This week our task was to:
•	Familiarise yourself with C# and .NET MAUI by building a test app that uses an SQLite database
•	Decide on a standard team workflow that everyone should follow when working on a GitHub issue
•	Import the list of issues into your team project
•	Choose an issue for each person on the team to work on and complete it following the team workflow
•	As a stretch goal, implement continuous integration (CI)

Getting started with the .NET MAUI.
I completed the tutorials which showed how to create a simple notes application and how to upgrade an app to use a local SQLite database, using two Microsoft Tutorials.

The team collaborated to ensure that a team workflow was created.

One of the stronger team members then imported all of the issues into the team project, which allowed us to pick an issue each. 
I would describe my performance in this task through the following areas as such:
•	Strengths – I felt I was available and willing to take on any work allocated to me.
•	Weaknesses – My knowledge made it difficult to understand fully how to complete my task.
•	Challenges – The team isn’t working particularly well together in my opinion. There is one main leader in the team who appears to be struggling at times to understand fully what we have to do, however seems to struggle to allow others to help or give suggestions.
•	Limitations – With us only communicating through Discord and not meeting up as a team, those who perhaps are struggling are left behind.
•	Potential Improvements – The team needs to be working as a team, not as it currently is where one or two individuals have all the power and the rest of the team isn’t aware of what to do.
•	Evidence – I have attached screen shots which I have taken during the task of picking an issue to work on. 
•	Problem Solving – There needs to be a lot more problem solving done as a team rather than just one or two individuals keeping everything to themselves. This could be achieved by meeting as a team to complete a Scrum.
