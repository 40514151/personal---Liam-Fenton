# Week 2 Setup

This week we were set a task to create a shared GitHub repository for the team, set up a project with an integrated task board, configure a personal copy of Visual Studio and to clone the shared repository.
 Shared GitHub – As a team we created a shared GitHub repository, which we worked collaboratively on to ensure that the full team were added, and we all had access to it. This was completed by working with each other face to face and dividing tasks up between us to ensure the full team were set up and had access.
Set up project – As a team we created the relevant GitHub repository with an integrated task board. Once again, we worked on this collaboratively to ensure the full team were set up for this.

Configure Visual Studio – This was the first time that I was downloading Visual Studio on my device, download was a straightforward case of downloading the file installer from a browser which then allowed me to configure Visual Studio set up straight through from first install. I configured the set up to my own preferences, as this will be one of the main programmes, I use to write code throughout my studies.
Clone Shared Repository – This was achieved by accessing the resources made available to us and cloning the repository. Again, each team member took part in this process and as a result we all completed the tasks set out, successfully.
